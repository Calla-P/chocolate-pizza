# chocolate-pizza

- Rather than the “complete as much of the assignment as you can in the available time” approach in Code 201, your challenge is to get the HTML/CSS mockup to be pixel-perfect
- Your column of content should be centered in the window, as in the preview image
- Your solution does not need to be responsive in any way
- Do not use any negative margins, grids, or flex positioning
Instructions:

1. Create and clone a new GitHub repository to house the code for this project.
2. Immediately check out a new branch in which to do your work.
3. Download and unzip these assets into an assets directory in your project.
4. Write your code in two files: index.html and style.css. You do not need to include JavaScript.
5. Use the included PREVIEW.png image as a reference; your goal is to match it as closely as possible.
6. Make regular Git commits with appropriately descriptive commit messages while you are working.
7. When finished, be sure to push your final code to GitHub and merge your branch into main.
8. Deploy your page on GitHub Pages via the options in the repository “Settings” tab.
9. Submit the links to your repository AND your deployed page in the corresponding Canvas assignment.

## Original instructions:

***Problem Domain***

Your boss comes up to you just before lunch: "OK, we just picked up this job, but I need it on my desk (well, in my inbox) in four hours. It doesn't need to be perfect... it needs to be as close to perfect as you can get it in that time."

In lab today you will be building a single webpage based off of the provided design comp assets. This assignment is a lot of HTML and CSS, and not as much JS as we've been doing this week. In fact, you may choose to do this project with no JS at all, or just add some as a finishing touch.

This will be a pair-programming project, and you are free to set up whatever workflow you choose with your partner.

You only have 4 hours to complete this assignment.

***Instructions***
It is your job to create a page that looks exactly like the preview below. Within your GitHub class repo, under today's directory, you will find all of the assets required to accomplish this task in addition to a larger version of this preview image.

Chocolate Pizza Preview

Use your notes from class, your readings, classmates, and the internet to assist with the completion of the lab. Research what you need and don't be afraid to try different techniques.

Create a new repository for today called chocolate-pizza. Follow the pair programming work flow by having one user fork the other so that you can get some practice in your Git processes. Be sure to do frequent commits, and always do your work on branches. Before starting coding, think about a strategy for approaching this project. Before writing code, think about a practical order in which to do the work:

When should you focus on styling?
When should you make a decision about a layout scheme?
When should you just build out the structure of the HTML?
When you should you add JS? Do you even add JS?
Don't forget to "swap" driver and navigator 2 hours into the challenge.

Suggestion: Set up your work directory like this:

index.html
style.css
app.js (if you choose to use JS)
img/ (a directory that contains all of your image assets)
If you want to rename any of the image files, feel free to do so. The same goes for pretty much anything else you come up with as a way to do the work.
